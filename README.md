This document is the summary of my study about grid maps.

Grid maps are basically maps with a grid that allows to locate positions based on simple Cartesian coordinates.

## Historical examples et famous ones

This first known cartographers to mention this kind of map are Zhang Heng (78-139) and Pei Xiu (224-271). The main goal was to increase the map accuracy in order to calculate the distance between two locations.
